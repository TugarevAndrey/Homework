            <p>Uruguay is a country in South America known for its lush greenery and beaches. In the center of the capital, the city of Montevideo, on Independence Square, there is the Citadel Gate - the surviving part of the fortress wall. From here begins the Old Town with Art Deco and colonial buildings. In its northwestern part, there is the Port Market, where you can try a steak in one of the many restaurants. Along the La Rambla are fish rows, marinas and parks.</p>
